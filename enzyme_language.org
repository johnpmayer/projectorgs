* Enzyme Programming Language
** Problem
   Microcontroller programming sucks, personally. Having to write code
   that observes all sorts of pins, and then manually doing updates,
   is obnoxious in the context of experience with functional
   programming. Code is often written in C/C++. The code can be
   translated by hand from reactive modeling languages, but this
   leaves error.
*** Research
    I don't know too much about automated compilation from models to code.
** Solution
   Develop a language with rooted in functional reactive
   programming FRP. Develop a runtime based on the ideas of CFRP
   (Concurrent FRP). Target AVR assembly.
** Approach
** Progress
